## A Reader for Radiation Blogs

#### To Do

- Render smart characters in ~erik's blog posts better
- figure out what to do about relative paths in ~erik's blog (probably doable!)
- move the runner logic into a runner file (out of newspaper model)
- better error handling when you enter a URL that is not radiation approved


#### Bigger Things to Add
- The CLI component
- mention notifications!
